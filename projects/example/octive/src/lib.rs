// This `#[no_mangle]` keeps rust from "mangling" the name and making it unique

// of a native method based on its name.
//
// The `'local` lifetime here represents the local frame within which any local
// (temporary) references to Java objects will remain valid.
//
// It's usually not necessary to explicitly name the `'local` input lifetimes but
// in this case we want to return a reference and show the compiler what
// local frame lifetime it is associated with.
//
// Alternatively we could instead return the `jni::sys::jstring` type instead
// which would represent the same thing as a raw pointer, without any lifetime,
// and at the end use `.into_raw()` to convert a local reference with a lifetime
// into a raw pointer.
